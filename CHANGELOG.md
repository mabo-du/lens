# Changelog

All notable changes to LENS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2026-06-24

First release candidate. Public-domain-format imports (txt / docx / pdf), structured
codebook with closure-table ancestry, prose-mirror-backed annotations, REFI-QDA export,
full-text search, project journals, annotated-image imports (Phase C MVP backend),
SQLite data layer with race-safe dedup, local-first Tauri 2 desktop shell.

### Added
- **Phase C MVP image coding (backend)** — Imports for PNG/JPG/JPEG via the Rust
  `image` crate's header-only dimension reader (no pixel allocation). Each image
  document records `intrinsic_w` / `intrinsic_h` (migration `04_image_format.sql`)
  ready for the upcoming region-annotation pipeline. The full Konva-based viewer
  with region drawing ships in v0.1.1.
- **Phase B correctness hardening** — Closure-table depth-stacking test
  (`closure_table_invariant_depth_stacking`) that proves `p.depth + s.depth + 1`
  composes transitively (Y → C must colon to depth 3 after a sub-tree move).
- **PDF extractor version bake** — `build.rs` now reads the pdfplumber pin from
  `src-tauri/sidecars/pdfplumber/requirements.txt` (fall-back to
  `pdfplumber-unknown` if the host Python is missing). The previous host-`python3`
  probe is gone, removing cross-environment ambiguity.
- **`documents_import_internal` UNIQUE-violation mapping** — Concurrent-import
  race window closed: the optimistic duplicate-check is preserved, but the
  UNIQUE(`project_id`, `text_hash`) constraint (migration 02) is now the final
  defense, mapped to a friendly duplicate message instead of a raw SQLite error.
- **Architecture documentation** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` rewritten as a comprehensive
  16-chapter sourcebook for future maintainers, with cross-references to all 19
  research papers under `docs/research-papers/`.
- **Apple signing onboarding runbook** — `docs/onboarding-apple-developer.md` +
  `scripts/set-release-secrets.sh`. Includes the BSD/macOS `base64 -b 0` fix,
  missing-file diagnostic output for `TAURI_KEY_FILE` overrides, and the
  `security find-identity` "between the double quotes" snippet.

### Changed
- **Project name validation** — `src/lib/validation.ts` rejects trailing path
  separators (`"foo/"` no longer collapses silently to `"foo"`) and produces a
  specific error message (`"Project name parts must not start with '.'"`).
- **Migration registry** — `src-tauri/src/db/migrations.rs` now lists migration
  04 alongside 01 / 02 / 03.
- **Document IPC type** — `src/ipc/documents.ts` extends `DocumentRecord` with
  optional `intrinsicW` / `intrinsicH` for image documents.

### Fixed
- **Concurrent-import race** — Optimistic duplicate-check + UNIQUE constraint +
  transaction wrap + `UniqueViolation` mapping combine to give race-safe dedup
  with a user-friendly error message.
- **Apple-signing `base64` crash** — macOS `base64` does not accept `-w 0`; the
  onboard runbook now uses `-b 0` (BSD-style) so the resulting secret actually
  fits in a GitHub Actions masked variable.

### Security
- Tauri 2 sandbox, strict CSP, asset-protocol scoped (no global FS access from
  renderer). Update endpoint pinned to `github.com/mabo-du/lens/releases/latest`
  with an explicit public key.

## [0.1.0-rc.2] - 2026-06-24

Patch-level RC. Re-tags 0.1.0-rc.1 with the release.yml matrix fix.
The rc.1 tag push (release run `28076077890`) failed across all 4
platforms with `log not found` because three pinned action SHAs in
`.github/workflows/release.yml` had drifted past the resolver — the
REST API returned HTTP 422 for every `actions/*@<sha>` reference.
No surface features change from rc.1.

### Fixed
- **release.yml matrix** — refreshes three pinned action SHAs to
  current live commits:
  - `actions/setup-node@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020` (v4)
  - `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@29eef336d9b2848a0b548edc03f92a220660cdb8` (stable)
  - `tauri-apps/tauri-action@fce9c6108b31ea247710505d3aaaa893ee6768d4` (v0 rolling)
- **release-dry-run.yml** — same `setup-node` + `rust-toolchain` SHA
  refresh; the manual `npx tauri build --no-bundle` step is preserved
  so this workflow continues to verify the pipeline *without* producing
  a draft release artefact (its stated purpose).

### Added
- **`scripts/refresh-release-sha-pins.sh`** — maintainer tool that
  diffs the workflow pins against the latest GitHub refs (defaults
  dry-run; `--apply` writes after confirmation). Companion to the
  release.yml release-process section in README.md.
- **README release-process docs** — the new "Release Process" section
  documents the cut-RC-then-promote workflow, the Apple-notarization
  secret prerequisites, and the inline SHA-bump procedure so future
  maintainers don't repeat the rc.1 matrix failure.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-24

Dependable image-doc UX: Konva-powered image viewer with drag-to-create bbox regions. The projected v0.1.1 plan ships in this release line (plan subset: viewer + bbox regions; polygon and memos-on-region rolled into v0.2).

### Added
- **Image-viewer + region drawing** — new `ImageViewer.tsx` mounts in `DocumentEditor` when `document.file_format` is `png`/`jpg`/`jpeg`. Renders the bitmap at its intrinsic width/height via react-konva, lets the researcher pick a code from the project tree, and drag-draws a bounding-box Rect on mouseup. Coordinates normalised to 0..1 at the IPC boundary so REFI-QDA AreaReference export can use them verbatim.
- **Migration 05 — `plain_text` nullable** — 12-step `CREATE TABLE _new` schema rebuild relaxes the NOT NULL constraint on `document.plain_text`. The prior round-70 attempt at `ALTER COLUMN ... DROP NOT NULL` broke 34/53 integration tests on the bundled SQLite ("unsupported ALTER TABLE" path); this rebuild is portable across every reasonable SQLite ≥ 3.7 since it relies only on native CREATE / INSERT / DROP / ALTER RENAME. FTS5 sync triggers recreated with `COALESCE(plain_text, '')` so image rows with NULL don't break full-text search.
- **Image-region IPC** — three new Tauri commands: `image_selection_create` (with bbox coord validation: rejects NaN/Infinity, out-of-range, zero-area, non-strict rectangles), `image_selection_list_by_document`, `image_selection_delete`. All wrapped in transactions; the `selection` parent row + `image_selection` extension row are inserted atomically.
- **Document-asset IPC** — `document_get_asset_base64` reads the bitmap from `assets/<id>.<ext>` on disk and returns a base64-encoded payload + MIME type so the renderer can construct a `data:image/png;base64,...` URL. Rejects non-png/jpg/jpeg formats at the dispatcher.
- **Frontend stack addition** — adds `konva` (10.x) + `react-konva` (19.x) to package.json.

### Changed
- **Image-import dispatcher** — `commands/import.rs` image branch now binds `plain_text: None` directly (vs the round-70 fallback to `Some("")`); combined with migration 05, this is the canonical post-cut path.

### Tests
- `image_selection_bbox_round_trip` — assert insert → SELECT (JOIN) → delete via FK cascade.
- `migration_05_relaxes_plain_text` — assert a row can be inserted with NULL `plain_text` and the value round-trips (closes the round-70 regression violation that originally broke 34 of 53 tests).

## [Unreleased]

### v0.2 — polygon-mode UX (frontend, this commit)

Building on the round-74 v0.2 polygon backend foundation (migration 06 +
`image_polygon` extension table + 3 IPC handlers + round-trip test + TS
IPC), the Konva image viewer now ships an interactive **polygon-mode
drawing tool** alongside the existing bbox mode.

#### ImageViewer — mode toggle (Rectangle | Polygon)

A pill-style toggle at the top-left of the viewer toolbar switches the
active drawing mode for the current image document. Default is
Rectangle (preserves the existing drag-to-create UX). Switching modes
cancels any in-flight draft of the other mode.

#### Polygon mode — interaction model

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Click on stage | Add a vertex at the cursor position |
| Move cursor (≥1 vertex placed) | Live preview line from last vertex to cursor |
| Right-click OR Enter | Commit polygon (requires ≥3 vertices); otherwise a toast hints to add more |
| Esc | Cancel the in-flight draft (discard vertices) |
| Click within 12px of vertex 0 (≥3 vertices already placed) | Highlighted snap-to-close ring on vertex 0 — visual only, click itself adds a duplicate vertex on top |

Once a polygon is committed, `imagePolygonsIpc.create` posts the record
with vertices serialised in 0..1 proportional coords. Polygon backend
validation (`validate_polygon`) enforces 3..64 vertices, finite values
in `[0,1]²`. The list auto-refreshes after every commit / delete.

#### Polygon rendering

Persisted polygons render as Konva `<Line closed=true>` with the
assigned code colour stroke and a 0.2-alpha fill, plus a small white
code-name label at the first vertex for parity with bbox labels. The
in-flight draft renders an uncommitted closed polygon at 0.08-alpha
fill, a small filled circle at every placed vertex, and a dashed
preview segment from the last vertex to the cursor. The snap-to-close
ring is an extra stroked circle (8px radius) around vertex 0 that
appears only when both conditions hold.

#### Polygon deletion

Right-click on a persisted polygon's stroke opens the same delete
confirmation as the bbox path — `imagePolygonsIpc.delete(id)`
followed by a list refresh. The selection FK on `image_polygon`
cascade-deletes on the parent `selection` row, so a single IPC
handles both.

### Planned for v0.2 (remaining)
- Memos-on-region binding (cross-document annotation memos)
- Konva vs custom-canvas performance benchmarking under WSL/Raspberry Pi 4
- Apple-signing release.yml matrix verification + GA cut
